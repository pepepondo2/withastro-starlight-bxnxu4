This is Aaron, your support agent for today. So, just to recap on a prior conversation, your Meta Quest 3 camera isn't working, correct?

I'm sending this email here as a follow-up to let you know that we're reviewing your case and have forwarded the details to our specialist team. You should hear from us within 48 hours on the status of the request. Thank you so much for contacting Meta today, Sam.

We'd love to help you sort this out as best we can, so we'll be keeping tabs on our communication here to ensure we can help you solve the issue. Our support is available 24/7, so feel free to reach out at anytime. It was a pleasure, and I hope we can update you soon.

Thanks for reaching out, and have a great weekend.
